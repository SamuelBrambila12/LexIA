## üöÄ What is LexIA?

LexIA is an innovative mobile application that combines cutting-edge artificial intelligence with effective language teaching methodology. It provides **instant, contextualized feedback on pronunciation and vocabulary** through an integrated multimodal system that analyzes both audio and visual input in real time.

Whether you're a self-learner or part of a formal education program, LexIA addresses a critical gap: the lack of immediate, actionable correction that prevents mistakes from becoming habits.

## üí° How It Works

### Pronunciation Module
1. Listen to the target word/phrase via Text-to-Speech
2. Record your pronunciation
3. Receive instant feedback with phoneme-level analysis
4. Get specific tips for improvement
5. Try again or move to the next exercise

### Visual Recognition Module
1. Open the camera or select an image from your gallery
2. Point at an object you want to learn
3. The CNN identifies the object in real-time
4. Get the translation in your target language
5. Hear the pronunciation via TTS
6. View contextual example sentences

### Adaptive Learning
- The system tracks your performance on each exercise
- Difficulty automatically increases/decreases based on your success rate
- You stay in the "sweet spot" for optimal learning (~60% correct)
- Personalized feedback helps you focus on weak areas
